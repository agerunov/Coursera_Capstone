    "The increasing standard of living and the generational shifts globally have produced a plethora of varied lifestyles that are reflected in the architecture, environmental planning, consumption habits, and social expression. One of the most distinct lifestyles is that of a so-called \"hipster\" that is often associated with refined consumption, vintage outlook, and a general ironic attitude towards established social norms and institutions. This has served as a magnet for many across different generations, and particularly Milliennials, and has been widely adopted. The interest in a hipster lifestyle also leads to the formation of specific spatially-delimited communities that are conducive for this lifestyle and feature its outlook, feel, and places and modes of consumption. Those are the so-called \"hipster neigborhoods\" that attract disproportionate interest from buyers and renters that identify or are sympathetic with this subculture. The rise in interest, and thus market demand, is also reflected in the rise of prices and change of community composition that partly fuels the process of gentrification. This is observed in many cities globally but it particularly fascinating in the case of emerging economies as this proceeds both rapidly and chaotically. For this project we take the casee of Bulgaria's capital city Sofia and try to identify its hipster neighborhoods and try to investigate their specifics."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The desirability of hipster neighbourhoods poses particular challenges for both the supply and the demand side of the housing market. Since it is difficult to define what a hipster neighborhood is there is significant information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and thus pricing cannot be set appropriately to reflect market conditions. Furthermore, the lack of sufficient data may lead to mislabeling a neighborhood as \"not hipster\" (i.e. undesirable) and thus impede its future growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key problem therefore is:\n",
    "- **There is no formal definition of hipster neighborhoods using objective criteria (i.e. data) and thus confusion reigns in the market. This results in improperly put price premia, leading to some suboptimal outcomes.** Sometimes sellers suffer as they fail to reach a fair price for a property in a hip cluster; and sometimes buyers suffer as they overpay for a supposedly hip place that is actually not so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end we need to complete a number of tasks:\n",
    "1. Study definitions of \"hipster\" and find convergence\n",
    "2. Operationalize the term so that it can be investigated formally\n",
    "3. Collect necessary data as per the term operationalization\n",
    "4. Using data identify and map hipster neighborhoods\n",
    "5. Outline most hipster neighboorhoods in the city of Sofia to inform both buyer and sellers of the possible price premium\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is a classic asymmetric information one and can thus be fruitfully solved using data science approaches."

   "source": [
    "What makes a neighborhood hipster has captured the imagination of many observers and as a topic found its distinguished place in both popular and academic discourse. As far back as 2012, *The Atlantic* (Doll, 2012) identified the overwhelming use (and mis-use) of the term and the plethora of popular ways to describe it. The closest to being a data-driven one is the analysis, prepared by travel website *Travel and Leisure* (Hunt, 2013) - *America's Best Cities for Hipsters*. It assessed each area's walkability, number of coffee shops, food trucks, farmer markets, locally owned bars and restaurants, residents in artistic occupations and how often hipster-related words appeared on a given neighborhood's web pages. While an interesting first foray, this analysis includes a very narrow set of indicators, and only focuses on US-American cities. This provides ample opportunity to step and build upon this approach, significantly expanding it, and applying it to a novel location such as Sofia.\n",
    "\n",
    "To to this, we need to better operationalize the term \"hipster\". While this has been amply researched such as in Jake Kinzey's book *The Sacred and the Profane* (Kinzey, 2010), complete consensus has failed to emerge. While authors such as Schiermer (2014), in his Acta Sociologica article *Late-modern Hipsters: New Tendencies in Popular Culture* focuses on behavioral and sociological manifestation of hipster cuture at the individual level, many authors instead focus on externa and enviromental signifiers of this community. Over the past decase, the academic community has observed somewhat of a convergence in views that we will use to operationalize the concept of hipster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Cronin et al. (2012) focus very much on food consumption as one defining facet of the hipster identify. More specifically, they outline three main practices that hipsters use to distinguish themselves from the mainstream and assert their lifestyle in a narrow and bounded community, namely:\n",
    "- Preference for vegetarian meals (or options);\n",
    "- Choices of specific (craft) brands and avoidance of others (mainstream brands);\n",
    "- Decommodification of the process of consuming food.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors further point out that those practice serve as points of resistance against the mainstream culture and prevent the co-optation of hipsters into the more established and even mundane lifestyles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Michael (2015) also focuses on consumption choices that are in opposition to the mainstream - particularly the fascination with vintage goods, kitsch retro styles and artisanal production. Hubbard (2016) adds to this definition further venues that are symptomatics a hipster identify such as authentic coffee shops, vintage stores, and bars that serve microbrews. However, while most authors and indeed the general public are rather positive of hipsters, Hubbard (2016) sees them as agents that seek to colonialize ethnic neighboorhoods, gentrify them, and displace the locals through economic means. This further validates the need of appropriately pricing hipster vs. non-hipster neighboorhoods that this project undertakes. Finally, LeBesco and Naccarato (2015) also investigate how hipsters express themselves through their food practices which enables them to compete with other alternative communities and subcultures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from the overview of the research on hipsters and their environment is that **hipster neighborhoods are distinguished by the following:**\n",
    "- Presence of a large variety of ethnic restaurants\n",
    "- Venues with artistic functions (e.g. dance studios, galleries, etc.)\n",
    "- Outlets conducive to activites associated with the subculture (e.g. yoga studios, photography studios)\n",
    "- Coffee shops\n",
    "- Local breweries (esp. micro-breweries)\n",
    "- Shops that offer a variety of non-traditional food options (e.g. organic food stores)\n",
    "- Places where vintage or retro items can be purchases, preferably at low prices (e.g. flea markets but not upscale antique shops)\n",
    "\n",
    "We conjecture that the **larger the concentration of hipster-related venues in a given neighborhood, the more hipster** this neighborhood is."

An extensive research could not find the necessary data in a structured form. The closest to that which is avaiable can be found on the website *Guide Bulgaria*. On the positive side this data is very detailed with 83 different neighborhood regions (or just neighborhoods from now on) and their respective coordinates. This level of granularity is much higher that admnistrative regions (only 24). On the negative side - this data is not structured and needs to be scraped from the site using a Python libary such as `Beautiful Soup` and then further processed into a `pandas` data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data on venues** - the Foursquare location data can be used to obtain a rich list of different venues around given coordinates.  This is furthermore useful as the level of detail of the venue categories is very high with over a hundred different types of venues. Such a level of detail enables us to segment each venue as a \"hipster\" (e.g. flea market) or \"non-hipster\" (e.g. gas station or fast food) venue and thus identify neighborhoods with a higher concentration of the former. This data is easy to obtain from Foursquare's API using Python `requests` libaray after creating a Foursquare developer account to obtain the credentials. This data is then processed and put into a `pandas` data frame."

    "Naturally, the total number of venues is hardly an indicator of how hipster a given space is - the neighborhood all needs to have the \"right\" venue in order to be elevated to the hipster status. Using the literature review and related work, we managed to identify a number of distinguishing hipster-type of venues that are commonly associated with this subculture. We mostly focused on the following:\n",
    "- Presence of a large variety of ethnic restaurants\n",
    "- Venues with artistic functions (e.g. dance studios, galleries, etc.)\n",
    "- Outlets conducive to activites associated with the subculture (e.g. yoga studios, photography studios)\n",
    "- Coffee shops\n",
    "- Local breweries (esp. micro-breweries)\n",
    "- Shops that offer a variety of non-traditional food options (e.g. organic food stores)\n",
    "- Places where vintage or retro items can be purchases, preferably at low prices (e.g. flea markets but not upscale antique shops)\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to distinguish better, we can go through unique venue categories and only retain those that meet the above criteria. All those types are collected in a list called `hipster` that contains typical categories,  including ethnic resturants, photgraphy and yoga studios, cafes, breweries, performing arts centers, flea markets, and many others.

    "The key business problem that we started with is the proper identification of hipster neighborhoods in the city of Sofia. Building upon the assumption that hipster neighborhoods are distinguished by a higher density of hipster-related venues we take the number of those within a certain radius as a proxy for the level of hipster-ness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research revealed that the **five most hip neighborhoods in the city of Sofia** are as follows:\n",
    "1.\tIztok;\n",
    "2.\tZona B-18;\n",
    "3.\tIvan Vazov;\n",
    "4.\tPoligona;\n",
    "5.\tLozenets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going through the list of neighborhoods we note a significant concentration of venues in the top performers, i.e. top hipster neighborhoods are significantly more so that the bottom ones. We can even go further to conjecture that the bottom-listed ones are artifacts of noise in data. This begs the important question of what the minimum number and type of venues that need to be present to make a place qualify as hipster, and from the data it seems that this is around 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second important insight is that we observe a **very large variance in the density of concentration of hipster venues**. There are neighborhoods with very high density, some with very low density, and a sizable group of 25 neighborhoods that do not have one single place that is associated with the hipster subculture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third major results from this study is that we observe **significant differences even among hipster neighborhoods in the city** that we can group into four distinct clusters. Each of those clusters is a particular expression of a different facet of the hipster lifestyle and is likely to appeal to a distinct group of individuals that are interested in the hipster subculture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We clearly see four distinct clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Turkish Quarters** - with a  very limited selection of other hipster-related venues, this cluster prominently features Turkish restaurants. While this may not be a hipster quarter per se, it is likely of ethnic origin and non-mainstream inhabitants. We consider it the least hipster, but also the most ethnic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Full Experience** - the second cluster features a wide range of hipster venues ranging from cafes and bookstores all the way to ethnic, vegetarian, soul food and non-traditional restaurants. It is also rich in lounges, music stores and places of artistic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chinese and Gourmet** - the third cluster focuses very much on Asian (Chinese) food and related experiences. It also has gourmet shops and gastropubs and a higher concentration of yoga studios. This cluster is recommended for hipster foodies looking for a more exotic experience with an Asian flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Art and Food** - this fourth cluster goes very much under two headings - exotic food and all kinds of art. It features Indian, Chinese, European, and Vegetarian restaurant but also places to listen to music, buy records or even stock up on flowers. This is somewhat of a nightlife cluster and highly recommended for day's end rather than beginning."

    "The results that stem from this small-scale project clearly show that Sofia is still a rather divided city – while there are some places with developing and vibrant hipster culture, about a third of the city shows no signs of that whatsoever. This may be due to different urban development trajectories or, more mundanely, to incomplete data. At any rate, this result is also echoed in popular opinion and media articles and is thus useful to corroborated with concrete, albeit imperfect, data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sharp divisions are also reflected in the divergent prices of real estate and hipster neighborhoods tend to attract more interest, and thus – differentiated price premia. The results quantify the amount of “hipster-ness” of a given neighborhood and allow sellers and buyer to compare neighborhoods based on an objective data-driven metric. The results also allow us to formulate a few recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Buyers or renters looking for hipster quarters** are well advised to consider the following hipster neighborhoods and avoid those in the non-hipster ones above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sellers or landlords** in one of the hipster neighborhoods may find it possible to raise the prices of their real estate, thus incorporating the hipster premium in them. On the other hands sellers and landlords in non-hipster neighborhoods may have to lower the prices so that it reflects demand and thus make deals possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Casual strollers and tourists** that would like to sample a hipster neighborhood of the city may want to choose what sort of experience they are looking for, and thus select where they go accordingly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Turkish Quarters**: Borovo, Dianabad, Hipodruma, Krasno Selo, Lagera, Manastirski Livadi, Mladost 4, Ovcha kupel, Pavlovo, Slatina\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Full Experience**: Lyulin 10, Lyulin 3, Lyulin 4, Mladost 3, Obelya 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chinese and Gourmet**: Bakston, Banishora, Beli brezi, Benkovski, Boyana, Darvenitsa, Dragalevtsi, Drujba 1, Drujba 2, Geo Milev, Gorublyane, Gotse Delchev, Hadji Dimitar, Hladilnika, Ivan Vazov, Izgrev, Iztok, Krasna Polyana, Lozenets, Lyulin 7, Lyulin 8, Malashevtsi, Mladost 1, Mladost 2, Moderno predgradie, Motopista, Musagenitsa, Nadejda 3, Poligona, Reduta, Stefan Karadja, Strelbishte, Studentski grad, Suhodol, Sveta Troitsa, Vrajdebna, Zaharna fabrika, Zona B-18, Zona B-5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Art and Food**: Nadejda, Suhata Reka, Zona B-19\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The results presented here do have **some limitations** such as their accuracy and the fact that data is static and not dynamic, but they still can serve both as stand-alone and as a foundation for future work. Most notably it would be useful to combine this data with property price data per neighborhood to quantitatively measure the size of the hipster premium. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since publicly available pricing data at the neighborhood level is not available, this will have to be scraped from a number of different publications. Another venue for future research is to have snapshots of venues at given dates (results obtained from Foursquare’s API on date) and these – saved in another database. While Foursquare does not provide time series, this approach will effectively do just that and enable us to follow trends of number and type of hipster venues over time."

    "This project started from the simple question of what makes a place “hipster” – something which is useful for everyone with an interest in a given neighborhood – both for people looking for goods, services and experiences; and for their suppliers. Knowing the type and particularities of a given locale enables everyone on the market to plan appropriately, set expectations, and price adequately. We combined Foursquare’s rich location data with geolocation data scraped from a publicly available website and used the operationalization of what hipster is to show which are the most hipster neighborhoods in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw that different expressions of this subculture lead to different flavors of neighborhoods that cluster neatly together in four groups. This insight allows us to direct strollers and tourists to the exact type of hipster experience they will enjoy most. This also holds true for potential property buyers who can now consciously choose to live in exactly the type of environment they are most fascinated with. In short, the project provided useful standalone insight for the development of a subculture in an emerging economy that can inform and entertain but also serve as a foundation for future work.\n"
